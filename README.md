## Computational Thinking with Algorithms - Project 2021
## Due: May 14th, 2021

Undergraduate of Computing (Data Analytics) at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. This repository contains the 2021 ``Project`` for the ``Computational Thinking with Algorithms module`` (5 Credits) of the ``Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics) (H.Dip)`` programme (75 Credits) at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT).

## Project

The project requires a Python application to benchmark five different sorting algorithms. In addition, the report introduces the algorithms chosen and discusses the results of the benchmarking process.

## Prerequisites

###### Anaconda

- Require Python to be loaded on your local machine. Recommend downloading and installing Anaconda.

###### dataframe-image

- ``dataframe-image`` allows the embeding of pandas DataFrames as images in pdf and markdown files when converting from Jupyter Notebooks [[Reference](http://web.archive.org/web/20210526125642/https://pypi.org/project/dataframe-image)].

- installed through ``PyPI``:

```
pip install dataframe_image
```

###### IPyPlot

- ``IPyPlot`` is a small Python package offering fast and efficient plotting of images using ``IPython`` with HTML for displaying large numbers of images [[Reference](http://web.archive.org/web/20201103205220/https://github.com/karolzak/ipyplot)].

- installed through ``PyPI``:

```
pip install ipyplot
```

- installed directly from repo using pip:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/karolzak/ipyplot
```
